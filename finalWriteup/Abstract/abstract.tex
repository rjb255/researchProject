\begin{abstract}

  The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic saw a high death toll which was reduced as drugs such as Remdesivir were introduced as treatments. This process was slow and few drugs were found capable of reducing the mortality of the virus. A solution to this issue is presented: finding existing, workable treatments using batch active learning. This combines greedy methodologies with clusters and uncertainty analysis, accumulating in a final algorithm \textit{RoDGer}. Algorithms were compared with each other, with the final algorithm learning the datasets at a 10\% faster rate than simply randomly sampling.
