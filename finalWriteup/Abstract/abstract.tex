\begin{abstract}

    The Sars-Cov-2 pandemic saw a high death toll which was reduced as drugs such as Remdesivir were introduced as treatments. This process was slow and few drugs were found capable of reducing the mortality of the virus. We present a solution to this issue: batch active learning on existing drugs. This combined greedy methodologies with cluterisations and uncertainty analysis. Algorithms were compared with each other, with the final algorithm learning the datasets at a 10\% faster rate than simple randomly sampling.
