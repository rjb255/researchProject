\section{Non-Parametric}
Non-parametric equations have the benefit of not requiring the minimisation function. Due to this, all testing of these algorithms were undertaken on a standard laptop. These also tend to be the easiest to implement, as uncovered in Chapter~\ref{ch:method}. Particularly important is the Monte Carlo method as this allows shows what should be a minimum baseline to achieve.

\subsection{Monte Carlo}
The first non-parametised algorithm discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:method} was the Monte Carlo method. Due to the non-parametric nature of this algorithm, execution was simply carried out on the test data set. Results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:MCTestSet}, demonstrating a final weighted mse of $0.92\pm{}0.43$.

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Greedy}
Likewise, the greedy algorithm was tested, with results presented in Figure~\ref{fig:GreedyTestSet}. Here, a final weighted mse of $0.95\pm{}0.37$ was found indicating a worse scoring despite more precise results when compared to Monte Carlo - the base case.

        \label{fig:GreedyTestSet}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{ROD Sampling}
The final non-parametic algorithm to be tested was ROD. A final weighted mse of $0.67\pm{}0.23$, over performing the previous two algorithms in both accuracy and precision.

\section{Parametric}
Parametric algorithms require a minimisation procedure on the training set. This leads to a computationally challenging script, and for this the author is grateful for the services provided by the HPC \cite{HPC}.
