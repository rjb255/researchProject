Active-learning methods assist the selection process by focusing on areas of chemical space that have the greatest chance of success while considering structural novelty. The core feature of these algorithms is their ability to adapt the structure–activity landscapes through feedback. Instead of full-deck screening, only focused subsets of compounds are tested, and the experimental readout is used to refine molecule selection for subsequent screening cycles. Once implemented, these techniques have the potential to reduce costs and save precious materials. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the various computational active-learning approaches and outline their potential for drug discovery.},

This will enable the development of treatments for diseases currently neglected for economic reasons, such as tropical and orphan diseases, and generally increase the supply of new drugs. Here, we report the Robot Scientist ‘Eve’ designed to make drug discovery more economical. A Robot Scientist is a laboratory automation system that uses artificial intelligence ({AI}) techniques to discover scientific knowledge through cycles of experimentation. Eve integrates and automates library-screening, hit-confirmation, and lead generation through cycles of quantitative structure activity relationship learning and testing. Using econometric modelling we demonstrate that the use of {AI} to select compounds economically outperforms standard drug screening. For further efficiency Eve uses a standardized form of assay to compute Boolean functions of compound properties. These assays can be quickly and cheaply engineered using synthetic biology, enabling more targets to be assayed for a given budget. Eve has repositioned several drugs against specific targets in parasites that cause tropical diseases. One validated discovery is that the anti-cancer compound {TNP}-470 is a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase from the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium vivax.},

	abstract = {The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can achieve greater accuracy with fewer labeled training instances if it is allowed to choose the training data from which is learns. An active learner may ask queries in the form of unlabeled instances to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. 
 
This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence for active learning, a summary of several problem setting variants, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning research are also presented.},

	abstract = {Active learning and structured stochastic bandit problems are intimately related to the classical problem of sequential experimental design. This paper studies active learning and best-arm identification in structured bandit settings from the viewpoint of active sequential hypothesis testing, a framework initiated by Chernoff (1959). We obtain a novel sample complexity bound for Chernoff's original active testing procedure by uncovering non-asymptotic terms that reduce in significance as the allowed error probability \${\textbackslash}delta {\textbackslash}rightarrow 0\$. Initially proposed for testing among finitely many hypotheses, we obtain the analogue of Chernoff sampling for the case when the hypotheses belong to a compact space. This allows us to directly apply it to active learning and structured bandit problems, where the unknown parameter specifying the arm means is often assumed to be an element of Euclidean space. Empirically, we demonstrate the potential of our proposed approach for active learning of neural network models and in linear and non-linear bandit settings, where we observe that our general-purpose approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods.},

Currently, there are no proven antiviral therapies for {COVID}-19. Numerous clinical trials have been initiated to identify an effective treatment. One leading candidate is remdesivir ({GS}-5734), a broad-spectrum antiviral that was initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus ({EBOV}). Although remdesivir performed well in preclinical studies, it did not meet efficacy endpoints in a randomized trial conducted during an Ebola outbreak. Remdesivir holds promise for treating {COVID}-19 based on in vitro activity against {SARS}-{CoV}-2, uncontrolled clinical reports, and limited data from randomized trials. Overall, current data are insufficient to judge the efficacy of remdesivir for {COVID}-19, and the results of additional randomized studies are eagerly anticipated. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of Ebola and coronavirus outbreaks. We then summarize preclinical and clinical studies of remdesivir for Ebola and {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {Key questions that scientists and engineers typically want to address can be formulated in terms of predictive science. Questions such as: "How well does my computational model represent reality?", "What are the most important parameters in the problem?", and "What is the best next experiment to perform?" are fundamental in solving scientific problems. Mystic is a framework for massively-parallel optimization and rigorous sensitivity analysis that enables these motivating questions to be addressed quantitatively as global optimization problems. Often realistic physics, engineering, and materials models may have hundreds of input parameters, hundreds of constraints, and may require execution times of seconds or longer. In more extreme cases, realistic models may be multi-scale, and require the use of high-performance computing clusters for their evaluation. Predictive calculations, formulated as a global optimization over a potential surface in design parameter space, may require an already prohibitively large simulation to be performed hundreds, if not thousands, of times. The need to prepare, schedule, and monitor thousands of model evaluations, and dynamically explore and analyze results, is a challenging problem that requires a software infrastructure capable of distributing and managing computations on large-scale heterogeneous resources. In this paper, we present the design behind an optimization framework, and also a framework for heterogeneous computing, that when utilized together, can make computationally intractable sensitivity and optimization problems much more tractable.},

	abstract = {We review the main components of autonomous scientific discovery, and how they lead to the concept of a Robot Scientist. This is a system which uses techniques from artificial intelligence to automate all aspects of the scientific discovery process: it generates hypotheses from a computer model of the domain, designs experiments to test these hypotheses, runs the physical experiments using robotic systems, analyses and interprets the resulting data, and repeats the cycle. We describe our two prototype Robot Scientists: Adam and Eve. Adam has recently proven the potential of such systems by identifying twelve genes responsible for catalysing specific reactions in the metabolic pathways of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This work has been formally recorded in great detail using logic. We argue that the reporting of science needs to become fully formalised and that Robot Scientists can help achieve this. This will make scientific information more reproducible and reusable, and promote the integration of computers in scientific reasoning. We believe the greater automation of both the physical and intellectual aspects of scientific investigations to be essential to the future of science. Greater automation improves the accuracy and reliability of experiments, increases the pace of discovery and, in common with conventional laboratory automation, removes tedious and repetitive tasks from the human scientist.},

	abstract = {We develop {BatchBALD}, a tractable approximation to the mutual information between a batch of points and model parameters, which we use as an acquisition function to select multiple informative points jointly for the task of deep Bayesian active learning. {BatchBALD} is a greedy linear-time \$1 - {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{e\}\$-approximate algorithm amenable to dynamic programming and efficient caching. We compare {BatchBALD} to the commonly used approach for batch data acquisition and find that the current approach acquires similar and redundant points, sometimes performing worse than randomly acquiring data. We finish by showing that, using {BatchBALD} to consider dependencies within an acquisition batch, we achieve new state of the art performance on standard benchmarks, providing substantial data efficiency improvements in batch acquisition.},

	abstract = {A novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2), or 2019 novel coronavirus] has been identified as the pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019. The main protease (Mpro , also called 3-chymotrypsin-like protease) of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is a potential target for treatment of {COVID}-19. A Mpro homodimer structure suitable for docking simulations was prepared using a crystal structure ({PDB} {ID}: 6Y2G; resolution 2.20 Å). Structural refinement was performed in the presence of peptidomimetic α-ketoamide inhibitors, which were previously disconnected from each Cys145 of the Mpro homodimer, and energy calculations were performed. Structure-based virtual screenings were performed using the {ChEMBL} database. Through a total of 1 485 144 screenings, 64 potential drugs (11 approved, 14 clinical, and 39 preclinical drugs) were predicted to show high binding affinity with Mpro . Additional docking simulations for predicted compounds with high binding affinity with Mpro suggested that 28 bioactive compounds may have potential as effective anti-{SARS}-{CoV}-2 drug candidates. The procedure used in this study is a possible strategy for discovering anti-{SARS}-{CoV}-2 drugs from drug libraries that may significantly shorten the clinical development period with regard to drug repositioning.},
