The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic saw a high death toll which was reduced as drugs such as Remdesivir were introduced as treatments. This process was slow and few drugs were found capable of reducing the mortality of the virus. A solution to this issue is presented: finding existing, workable treatments using batch active learning. This combines greedy methodologies with clusters and uncertainty analysis, accumulating in a final algorithm *RoDGer*. Algorithms were compared with each other, with *RoDGer* producing a learning rate of $17.70\pm{}0.26$ compared to a learning rate of $16.32\pm{}0.36$ for random sampling. This was undertaken in a framework providing consistency between different algorithms, as well as providing a means of fitting parameters to different algorithms.
